Good morning! This was after 20 hours of navigation at 7am.

Thembi in Tanger

I left Rabat-Salé and moved to [Tanger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanger). 24 hours of navigation, more or less. Solo, but with almost zero wind… Here some picture of the trip. Seeing the Strait of Gibraltar in front of me was a strong emotion!
