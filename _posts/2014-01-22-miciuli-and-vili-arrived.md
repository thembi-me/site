All these photos are about the trip from Rome to Brighton. It was a great adventure! And I want to say thank you to Enrico, Reneâ€™, Riccardo and Samuele.

Last weekend, with Glenda and Tiziana, we moved my cats from [Torino](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=Turin,+Italy&hl=en&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=61.540818,135.263672&oq=torino&hnear=Turin,+Piedmont,+Italy&t=m&z=12) to Thembi, by train and car. Soon some photo of Miciuli and Vili.

Will be fun to teach how to sail to my two wonderful cats.
