[Lobos Island](https://www.google.es/maps/place/Lobos+Island/@28.7508714,-13.8233726,14z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0xc46347fbb710af7:0xb1bbc2ee8a2b8006?hl=en) is a beautiful island between Forteventura and Lanzarote. It is a nature reserve. More information on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobos_Island).

We went sailing here from Las Palmas to Gran Tarajal, and then to Lobos Island. We had wind at 20-30 knots NNE and 2-3 meters of waves. Not too bad.
