Smir marina in front of me  

I entered in the Mediterranean sea! Some waves at the beginning, just in front of Tanger, but then flat sea and strong wind (20-30knots). With genoea for the first 20 miles, wind coming from Ovest, up to 7-8 knots. Then I opened the main sail with 2 reefs and, in close-hauled, I arrived at [Marina Smir](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Marina+Smir,+Morocco/), Morocco.
