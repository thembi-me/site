Walking from Salé to [Barrage Mohamed Ben Abdellah](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Barrage+Sidi+Mohamed-Ben-Abdellah,+Morocco) following the Oued Abou Regreg river.

How you can see, the coast of this lake is quite polluted and covered by plastic bags, but it offers an amazing view.

Note the cliff covered by trash in front of Youssoufia.
